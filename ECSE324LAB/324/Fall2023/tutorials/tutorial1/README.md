# Tutorial 1
## Tutorial questions

Here are questions that will be solved during the tutorial.

1. Simplify the following logical expression: f=(a'+b'+c+d)x(a'+b'+c+d')x(a'+b'+c'+d')x(a+b'+c'+d')x(a+b+c'+d')x(a+b+c'+d)x(a+b'+c'+d)x(a'+b+c'+d), where + is the OR operation, x is the AND operation, and ' is the NOT operation.
2. What is the difference between a demultiplexer and a decoder?
3. Design a combinationial circuit for the 4-2 one-hot encoder. All possible inputs are 1000, 0100, 0010, 0001, and the 2-bit output should be the index where the bit 1 in the input stream is located.
4. What is the difference between a latch and a flip-flop?
5. What is the difference between different a Mealy and a Moore Machine of a finite state machine (FSM)?
6. Write down a state transition diagram for a sequence detector that detects two consecutive bit 1s in the input data stream. 1 bit arrives at the input per clock cycle. For example, a bit 0 arrives at the clock period 1, a bit 1 arrives at the clock period 2, a bit 1 arrives at the clock period 3, and the detector outputs a signal for successfully detecting two consecutive bit 1s. If the next incoming bit is 1 after two consecutive bit 1s are detected, the detector still outputs the signal for successfully detecting two consecutive bit 1s.
